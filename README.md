Origin of Project Name

SUI's symbol is a water droplet, when a large amounts of SUI come together, they form a puddle. Therefore, this is why we are called “Puddle Finance”.

Solved Problem
---
* In the past, establishing a fund required a complex procedure, often leading people to give up. Even if a fund was established, if you were not a well-known investor, it was unlikely that any investors would entrust their assets to you. 

* Puddle Finance aims to build a platform that allows anyone to easily create a fund, share investment experiences, and help investors who have no time to do research for investments to earn profits. Since all actions of traders are recorded on the blockchain, investors can see the actions of traders in real time.
